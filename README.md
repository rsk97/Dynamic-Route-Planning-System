The aim is track and regulate the traffic of a city. Vehicles are monitored either by embedded GPS modules or via android app installed in Drivers phone.
The entire whereabouts of the vehicle including route taken, speed etc can tracked. This also helps to add restrictions over vehicles to travel on certain routes during certain hours of the day by providing instant penalisation.
